All notable changes to this project are recorded here. Versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Version 1.0.0 is not released. Publication is blocked until the Windows and WSL certification
matrix passes on both platforms, including the rows that can only be checked by hand.

### Added

- Five separated roles — architect, executor, functional reviewer, security reviewer, arbiter —
  with separation of powers enforced at three independent layers.
- The immutable original request, carried intact to the arbiter and held by a database trigger that
  refuses to rewrite it.
- Evidence engine: gates discovered from the project, and mandatory gates inserted where a change
  touches a layer that has no proof for it.
- Deterministic design gates and a security gate that requires an executed proof.
- Byte-exact candidate freeze and re-verified delivery.
- Incremental semantic code graph over twelve languages, built locally with no model calls.
- Evidence-linked project memory with two-level retrieval.
- Append-only project history with a hash chain and signed checkpoints.
- Multi-milestone Goal Mode with completion gates.
- Admission control with memory, CPU and disk monitoring.
- Per-role model and effort configuration, defaulting to the session model.
